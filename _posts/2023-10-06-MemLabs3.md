# Introduction

Last time, I posted a solution that shows how I approached the [second lab](https://oviche.github.io/2023/10/MemLabs2/) of [MemLabs](https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs/tree/master) challenges. This post continues to show how I got the flags for the third lab of MemLabs, called **"The Evil's Den"**.

# Extracting the clues from description

The following is the challenge description that contains the needed clues to solve this lab.

> A malicious script encrypted a very secret piece of information I had on my system. Can you recover the information for me please?
> Note-1: This challenge is composed of only 1 flag. The flag split into 2 parts.
> Note-2: You'll need the first half of the flag to get the second.
> You will need steghide to solve the challenge,
