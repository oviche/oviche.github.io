description: The post shows the steps for finding the flags for the final challenge of MemLabs.

# Introduction

Last time, I posted a solution that shows how I approached the [fifth lab](https://oviche.github.io/2023/11/MemLabs5/) of [MemLabs](https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs/tree/master) challenges. This post continues to show how I got the flags for the final lab of MemLabs, called **"The Reckoning"**.

# Extracting the clues from description

The following is the challenge description that contains the needed clues to solve this lab.
> **We received this memory dump from the Intelligence Bureau Department. They say this evidence might hold some secrets of the underworld gangster David Benjamin. This memory dump was taken from one of his workers whom the FBI busted earlier this week. Your job is to go through the memory dump and see if you can figure something out. FBI also says that David communicated with his workers via the internet so that might be a good place to start.**

> **Note: This challenge is composed of 1 flag split into 2 parts.**

I managed to extract the following clue:
- **FBI also says that David communicated with his workers via the internet so that might be a good place to start**, is a hint to investigate browser-related activities.

# Finding the image profile

First of all, we need to find the profile of the memory image using imageinfo plugin as in the following command.
> CommandLine 
{:.filename}
{% highlight CMD %}
$ ./vol -f MemoryDump_Lab6.raw imageinfo
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6
INFO    : volatility.debug    : Determining profile based on KDBG search...
          Suggested Profile(s) : Win7SP1x64, Win7SP0x64, Win2008R2SP0x64, Win2008R2SP1x64_23418, Win2008R2SP1x64, Win7SP1x64_23418
                     AS Layer1 : WindowsAMD64PagedMemory (Kernel AS)
                     AS Layer2 : FileAddressSpace (/home/oviche/Desktop/memlabs/MemoryDump_Lab6.raw)

     Image local date and time : 2019-08-19 20:11:58 +0530
{% endhighlight %}

The first suggested profile **"Win7SP1x64"** worked in my case.

# Reviewing the running processes

Firstly, I thought to check the running processes to find a good starting point using the `pslist` plugin.

![img]({{'/assets/images/MemLab6/img1.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }*(**The running processes**)*

As appears in the above screenshot, there are four important processes:
1. **cmd.exe** process that indicates that some commands get executed.
2. **WinRAR.exe** process that may be used to extract a compressed file.
3. **chrome.exe** processes that are instances of **chrome** browser.
4. **firefox.exe** processes that are instances of **firefox** browser.

Let's begin with inspecting **WinRAR** and **cmd**. After that, I will examine the browser activities of **Chrome** and **Firefox**.

# Inspecting WinRAR process

At this step, I will look at command line arguments for the WinRAR process using the `cmdline` plugin.

> CommandLine 
{:.filename}
{% highlight CMD %}
$ ./vol -f MemoryDump_Lab6.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 cmdline -p 3716
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6
************************************************************************
WinRAR.exe pid:   3716
Command line : "C:\Program Files\WinRAR\WinRAR.exe" "C:\Users\Jaffa\Desktop\pr0t3ct3d\flag.rar"
{% endhighlight %}

As appears above, the command line argument of the WinRAR process contains a **flag.rar** file. So, let's dump that file using the following commands.

> CommandLine 
{:.filename}
{% highlight CMD %}
$ ./vol -f MemoryDump_Lab6.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 filescan | grep "flag.rar"
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6
0x000000005fcfc4b0     16      0 R--rwd \Device\HarddiskVolume2\Users\Jaffa\Desktop\pr0t3ct3d\flag.rar

$ ./vol -f MemoryDump_Lab6.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 dumpfiles -Q 0x000000005fcfc4b0 -D DumpedFiles6
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6
DataSectionObject 0x5fcfc4b0   None   \Device\HarddiskVolume2\Users\Jaffa\Desktop\pr0t3ct3d\flag.rar
{% endhighlight %}

When I tried to extract the **flag.rar**, I found that it's protected by a password, as appears below.
> CommandLine 
{:.filename}
{% highlight CMD %}
$ unrar x flag.rar

Extracting from flag.rar

Enter password (will not be echoed) for flag2.png:
{% endhighlight %}


# Inspecting the executed commands

As previously mentioned, one of the running processes is **cmd.exe**. I thought to find the executed commands using the `consoles` plugin.

![img]({{'/assets/images/MemLab6/img2.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }*(**The executed commands**)*

As appears in the above image, the unrecognized command **env** gets executed, which seems like a hint to check the environment variables.

Thus, let's examine the environment variables using the "envars" plugin to find if something is interesting.

![img]({{'/assets/images/MemLab6/img3.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }*(**Snippet from environment variables**)*

As appears above, the password **easypeasyvirus** for the protected **flag.rar** is there.

After extracting it with the password, the following image with the second part of the flag is found.

![img]({{'/assets/images/MemLab6/flag2.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }*(**The second part of the flag**)*
