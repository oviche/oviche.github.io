# Introduction
That is my first post in 2024, so I thought to refresh my knowledge about binary exploitation by going through the [pwnable.xyz](https://pwnable.xyz/) challenges in my free time. This post will be the write-up for the first challenge **"Welcome"**.

# Gaining insights of the binary

- The first step I usually do, is to check the mitigations of the binary using the `checksec` command in pwndbg. The command's output shows that all the mitigations are turned on.

![img]({{'/assets/images/PwnableXYZ-Welcome/img1.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }*(**The mitigations status**)*

- By executing the binary, I found that it prints out a hexadecimal number representing a memory address leak and receives two inputs, which are the message's length and the message itself, as shown below.
> CommandLine 
{:.filename}
{% highlight CMD %}
$ ./challenge
Welcome.
Leak: 0x7f318f02c010
Length of your message: 5
Enter your message: aaaaa
aaaa
