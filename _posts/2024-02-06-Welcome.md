# Introduction
That is my first post in 2024, so I thought to refresh my knowledge about binary exploitation by going through the [pwnable.xyz](https://pwnable.xyz/) challenges in my free time. This post will be the write-up for the first challenge **"Welcome"**.

# Checking the mitigations

- The first step I usually do, is to check the mitigations of the binary using the `checksec` command in pwndbg. The command's output shows that all the mitigations are turned on.
