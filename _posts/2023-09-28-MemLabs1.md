# Introduction

I decided to refresh my memory forensics knowledge by going through [**MemLabs**](https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs) CTF-styled challenges and this post is writeup for the first challenge named **"Beginner's Luck"**. 

# Extracting the clues from the description

The following is the statement of the challenge that contains the clues that should be extracted to plan how to approach the challenge.

> My sister's computer crashed. We were very fortunate to recover this memory dump. Your job is get all her important files from the system. From what we remember, we suddenly saw a black window pop up with some thing being executed. When the crash happened, she was trying to draw something. Thats all we remember from the time of crash.

The following three important clues are noticed:

1. **"Your job is get all her important files from the system"**; so first mission is recover her important files.
2. **"we suddenly saw a black window pop up with some thing being executed"**; Thus, the second mission is to check the **CMD**'s executed commands.
3. **"When the crash happened, she was trying to draw something"**; Hence, the third mission is to find what she was drawing at the time.

# Recovering the important files 

Before starting to look for the important file, the profile of the memory image must be identified using the following command of volatility and the first profile (**Win7SP1x64**) worked for me.

> CommandLine 
{:.filename}
{% highlight CMD %}
$ ./vol -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw imageinfo
{% endhighlight %}
![img]({{'/assets/images/MemLab1/img1.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }*(**The suggested profiles**)*

Now, we can start looking for the important files using the `filescan` plugin as shown below.

> CommandLine 
{:.filename}
{% highlight CMD %}
$ ./vol -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 filescan
{% endhighlight %}
![img]({{'/assets/images/MemLab1/img2.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }*(**The results from filescan plugin**)*

As appears in the above screenshot, a lot of file objects were found. However, we can narrow the search results down to the files from the **"Alissa Simpson"** directory as we search for the files for a girl based on the challenge description.

So the following command is used to find the search results for the **"Alissa Simpson"** directory.
> CommandLine 
{:.filename}
{% highlight CMD %}
$ ./vol -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 filescan | grep "Alissa Simpson"
{% endhighlight %}
![img]({{'/assets/images/MemLab1/img3.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }*(**Files from Alissa Simpson directory**)*

As noticed in the above screenshot, there are files named **important.rar** and based on the challenge statement, we need to find her "important" files. Thus, let's dump the file from memory using the following command.
> CommandLine 
{:.filename}
{% highlight CMD %}
$ ./vol -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 dumpfiles -Q 0x000000003fac3bc0 --name importantFile.rar -D DumpedFiles/
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6
DataSectionObject 0x3fac3bc0   None   \Device\HarddiskVolume2\Users\Alissa Simpson\Documents\Important.rar
{% endhighlight %}

As appears in the below screenshot, when I tried to decompress the file, I found that it's protected with a password which is uppercase of NTLM hash for the Alissa password.

> CommandLine 
{:.filename}
{% highlight CMD %}
$ unrar x importantFile.rar

UNRAR 6.11 beta 1 freeware      Copyright (c) 1993-2022 Alexander Roshal

Extracting from importantFile.rar

Password is NTLM hash(in uppercase) of Alissa's account passwd.

Enter password (will not be echoed) for flag3.png:
{% endhighlight %}

Now let's use a volatility plugin called `hashdump` to extract NTLM for Alissa Simpson that equals **f4ff64c8baac57d22f22edc681055ba6**. Then we convert its characters to uppercase to get the password for rar file.
> CommandLine 
{:.filename}
{% highlight CMD %}
$ ./vol -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 hashdump | grep "Alissa"

Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6
Alissa Simpson:1003:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:f4ff64c8baac57d22f22edc681055ba6:::
{% endhighlight %}

After successfully decompressing the rar file, the following image is found which contains the third flag.

![img]({{'/assets/images/MemLab1/img4.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }*(**The image file containing the third flag**)*

# Discovering CMD's executed commands

Now, we move to the second clue which states that a black window (probably CMD) with something being executed (referring to command execution). To confirm this thought, we need to check the running processes list using the `pslist` plugin.

![img]({{'/assets/images/MemLab1/img5.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }*(**The list of running processes**)*
