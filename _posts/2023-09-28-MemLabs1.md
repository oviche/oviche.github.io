# Introduction

I decided to refresh my memory forensics knowledge by going through [**MemLabs**](https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs) CTF-styled challenges and this post is writeup for the first challenge named **"Beginner's Luck"**. 

# Extracting the clues from the description

The following is the statement of the challenge that contains the clues that should be extracted to plan how to approach the challenge.

> My sister's computer crashed. We were very fortunate to recover this memory dump. Your job is get all her important files from the system. From what we remember, we suddenly saw a black window pop up with some thing being executed. When the crash happened, she was trying to draw something. Thats all we remember from the time of crash.

The following three important clues are noticed:

1. **"Your job is get all her important files from the system"**; so first mission is recover her important files.
2. **"we suddenly saw a black window pop up with some thing being executed"**; Thus, the second mission is to check the **CMD**'s executed commands.
3. **"When the crash happened, she was trying to draw something"**; Hence, the third mission is to find what she was drawing at the time.

# Recovering the important files 

Before starting to look for the important file, the profile of the memory image must be identified using the following command of volatility and the first profile (**Win7SP1x64**) worked for me.

> CommandLine 
{:.filename}
{% highlight CMD %}
$ ./vol -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw imageinfo
{% endhighlight %}

![img]({{'/assets/images/MemLabs1/img1.PNG' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }*(**The suggested profiles**)*
